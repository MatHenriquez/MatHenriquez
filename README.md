# Â¡Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ <br />

My name is MatÃ­as HenrÃ­quez ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ <br />
(You can call me Matt ðŸ˜‰)
<hr />

## About me: ðŸ’¬ðŸ’¬ <br />
I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Argentina and I love programming since my 17 years when I met my first coding language: C++ <br /> <br />
Although it took me a long time to decide to leave my previous studies (where programming was a secondary tool) to dedicate myself to Software Development, in the end it became too evident that this was my passion. <br /> <br />
After dabbling in areas such as microcontroller development using Assembler and C++ and creating mobile applications with Java, I found my true calling: Web Development, which allows me to be part of the dream of enabling people to showcase their businesses and services to the whole world.

<hr />

## My tasks: <br />
Currently I work as a Full Stack Developer and I continue to deepen the knowledge I have in my technology stack even in my free time.

<hr />

## My goals: <br />
I seek to gain great skill in the use of the technologies required to develop, test and deploy high quality web applications. Also, it is equally important for me to acquire the best programming practices to produce readable and maintainable code to ensure that I provide the highest quality products possible.

## Technologies I use:
